<span class="dcap">H</span>ere are my basic philosophy for writing on the web.

* Drum out whatever comes to your mind first.
* Never delete anything you type. Leave editing for later.
* Don't use auto correct.
* Don't waste time changing configuration. Just write. This means not changing themes.
* Never read the comments. Better still, just disable them.
* Disable page views and Google Analytics. Readers just come. There's nothing more to it.
* Never write for money or for commercial advantage.
* Be outrageous. Hold nothing back. The web isn't the place to be politically correct.
