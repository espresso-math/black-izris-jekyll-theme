<span class="dcap">I</span>n the begining were the axioms and the axioms were with Euclid. For a long time this was the case until western mathematics was reformulated again at the end of the [century] century. Let me introduce you to the Dedekind-Peano Axioms of Arithmetics.

#### The Dedekind-Peano Axioms[^1]

1. 1 is a number.
2. 1 isn't the sucessor of any number.
3. The sucessor of any number is a number.
4. No two numbers have the same sucessor.
5. (Postulate of Mathematical Induction) If a set contains 1, and if the successor of any number in the set also belongs to the set, then every number belongs to the set.
